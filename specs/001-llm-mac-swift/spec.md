**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ëøô‰∏™È°πÁõÆÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™‰ΩøÁî®LLMËøõË°åËØ≠Èü≥ËæìÂÖ•ÁöÑÂ∑•ÂÖ∑Ôºå‰∏ªË¶ÅËøêË°åÂú®Mac‰∏äÔºåÂºÄÂèëËØ≠Ë®ÄÈÄâÁî® Swift„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: "LLM-enhanced voice input tool for macOS using Swift"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Actors: macOS users, LLM service; Actions: voice input, transcription, enhancement; Platform: macOS; Language: Swift
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: LLM integration method not specified - local model, API service, or both?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Voice input scope not defined - dictation, commands, or both?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target user workflow not specified - continuous dictation, push-to-talk, or voice commands?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Primary user story defined for voice input with LLM enhancement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Requirements generated with testable criteria
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Voice recording, transcription, LLM enhancement, user preferences identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚ö† WARN "Spec has uncertainties - LLM integration and input methods need clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a macOS user, I want to use voice input to create text content that is automatically enhanced and improved by an LLM, so that I can efficiently produce high-quality written content without typing while benefiting from AI assistance for grammar, clarity, and style improvements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the voice input tool is running on macOS, **When** I speak into my microphone, **Then** my speech is transcribed to text and automatically enhanced by LLM for grammar and clarity
2. **Given** I have spoken a sentence with grammatical errors, **When** the LLM processes the transcription, **Then** the output text shows corrected grammar while preserving my intended meaning
3. **Given** I want to control the voice input process, **When** I use the designated activation method [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: hotkey, button, voice activation?], **Then** the tool starts/stops recording my voice input
4. **Given** the LLM enhancement is complete, **When** the final text is ready, **Then** the enhanced text is made available for use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: clipboard, text field, file output?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the microphone is not available or permission is denied?
- How does the system handle unclear or mumbled speech?
- What occurs when the LLM service is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the tool behave when the user speaks in multiple languages?
- What happens when the user speaks for an extended period without pausing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture audio input from the user's microphone on macOS
- **FR-002**: System MUST transcribe spoken audio into text with reasonable accuracy
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with LLM service to enhance transcribed text [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which LLM service - OpenAI, local model, configurable?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide user control over when voice input starts and stops [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: activation method not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST deliver enhanced text output to the user [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output destination not specified]
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle microphone permissions according to macOS security requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide feedback to user about recording status and processing state
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to configure LLM enhancement preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what preferences - style, tone, language?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain user privacy and data security during voice processing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention policy not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST operate efficiently on macOS without significantly impacting system performance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Voice Recording**: Audio data captured from microphone, including metadata like duration and quality settings
- **Transcription**: Text representation of spoken audio, with confidence scores and timing information
- **LLM Enhancement**: Processed text output from language model, including original and enhanced versions
- **User Preferences**: Configuration settings for voice input behavior, LLM parameters, and output options
- **Session Data**: Temporary data for active voice input sessions, including processing status and error handling
