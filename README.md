JoeVoice is a native macOS voice transcription application built for privacy and efficiency. Using local AI models, it converts speech to text with high accuracy while keeping all data on your device. You can download the app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZhenchongLi/JoeVoice/releases/latest).

After dedicating the past 5 months to developing this app, I've decided to open source it for the greater good.

The goal is to create **the most efficient and privacy-focused voice-to-text solution for macOS** that is intuitive to use. While the source code is available for developers to build and contribute, purchasing the app supports continued development and provides automatic updates, priority support, and access to new features.

## Features

- üîí **Privacy First**: 100% offline processing ensures your data never leaves your device
- ‚ö° **Power Mode**: Intelligent context detection that automatically applies optimized settings based on your active application or browser URL
- üß† **Context Awareness**: Smart AI adaptation that understands your current environment and adjusts transcription accordingly
- üéØ **Global Shortcuts**: Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick recording and push-to-talk functionality
- üìù **Personal Dictionary**: Customize transcription accuracy with custom vocabulary, industry terminology, and intelligent text replacements
